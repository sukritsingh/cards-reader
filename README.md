# CARDS-reader

## A library of methods to analyze the CARDS framework 

The CARDS-reader is a library of scripts and methods that are built to analyze
and work with CARDS data. It contains a series of methods as well a few ready-made
apps scripts.

## Requirements

CARDS-reader is built to work in python 3. Specifically anything above 3.5 should 
work. 

To use CARDS-reader, the following other python packages must also be installed: 
* Enspara (download at https://github.com/bowman-lab/enspara)
* MDTraj (download at mdtraj.org)

Other standard libraries (eg. numpy, scipy, scikit-learn) should also be installed, 
but are easily available with most package managers such as Anaconda. 

## Usage 

CARDS-reader was built with the enspara package in mind, specifically to analyze 
CARDS output from enspara.
